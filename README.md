## 📋 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server with live reload |
| `npm start` | Alias for `npm run dev` |
| `npm run serve` | Static server without live reload |
| `npm run validate` | Validate HTML markup |
| `npm run lighthouse` | Run performance audit |
| `npm test` | Run validation and performance tests |

## 🔧 Development Features

- **Live Reload** - Page refreshes when files change
- **WebSocket Connection** - Real-time communication

- **Performance Monitoring** - Lighthouse integration
- **HTML Validation** - Markup quality checks

## 📱 Mobile Testing

1. **Network Access Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Dev server displays your network IP
   npm run dev
   # Look for: 🌐 Network: http://192.168.1.XXX:3009
