# BiasGuard ML Engine - Master Improvement Plan
## Expert-Validated Enhancement Strategy

### CRITICAL FINDINGS
- Current system fails to detect obvious bias ("white people suck" = 0%)
- Pattern matching limited to abstract keywords only
- No multi-layer detection (specific + sentiment + context)
- Inconsistent scoring across three engine implementations

### PHASE 1: CORE DETECTION ENHANCEMENT
1. **Multi-Layer Pattern System**
   - Abstract keywords (policy language)
   - Specific identifiers (demographic groups)
   - Negative sentiment terms
   - Context amplifiers
   - Combination bonuses

2. **Enhanced Scoring Algorithm**
   - Composite scoring vs simple linear
   - Dynamic severity mapping
   - Pattern interaction bonuses
   - Context-aware weighting

### PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURAL CONSISTENCY  
1. **Unified Engine Standards**
   - Consistent patterns across all three engines
   - Standardized scoring methodology
   - Synchronized fallback behavior

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Intersectional bias detection
   - Temporal bias patterns
   - Geographic bias indicators
   - Linguistic bias markers

### PHASE 3: VALIDATION & MONITORING
1. **Expert Test Suite**
   - 100+ bias scenarios from research
   - Edge case validation
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Accuracy measurement

2. **Continuous Learning**
   - Pattern evolution tracking
   - False positive/negative analysis
   - Community feedback integration
   - Expert review cycles

### SUCCESS METRICS
- "white people suck" → 85%+ bias score
- Demographic bias detection → 95%+ accuracy
- Processing time → <10ms maintained
- False positive rate → <5%
